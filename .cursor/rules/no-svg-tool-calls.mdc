### SVG Handling Guidance

- Do NOT open or tool-call `.svg` assets directly during exploration; treat them as opaque static files.
- Refer to public asset paths instead of importing SVGs when creating fallbacks in components.
- If you must reference an icon, prefer a stable path under `public/` (e.g., `/icons/arrow-gray-32.png`) rather than reading the SVG content.
