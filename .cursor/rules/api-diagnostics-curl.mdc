# API Diagnostics via cURL (User-run)

When debugging APIs or needing live JSON to proceed, do NOT ask the user to open URLs in a browser. Instead, provide user-run cURL commands and ask them to paste the JSON output back.

Rules:
- Always share commands as instructions to run manually. Do not execute them.
- Prefer concise, copy-pastable cURL with: -sS, explicit -X method, and necessary headers.
- For POST JSON, include -H "Content-Type: application/json" and -d '{...}'.
- For admin-protected endpoints, show a cookie-jar flow so a single terminal session can authenticate then call the endpoint.
- Ask the user to paste the raw JSON response in a fenced code block.

Examples (instruction only; do not execute):

```bash
# User-run: check admin debug
curl -sS -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/debug
```

```bash
# User-run: log in as admin, save cookie, then call debug
# Replace <ADMIN_PASSWORD> with your value
curl -sS -c cookies.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password":"<ADMIN_PASSWORD>"}' http://localhost:3000/api/admin/login
curl -sS -b cookies.txt -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/debug
```

```bash
# User-run: ingest Wowhead (admin-only), then fetch articles
curl -sS -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingest-wowhead
curl -sS -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/articles
```

If the project is deployed, replace http://localhost:3000 with the Vercel URL. Always request that the user paste the JSON output so you can incorporate it directly into your response and next steps.
