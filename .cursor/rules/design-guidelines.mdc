# Design and UX Guidelines

Follow a WoW-adjacent aesthetic without infringing on copyrights or trademarks.

## Visual style
- Use a dark, arcane-inspired background with subtle radial gradients (see `bg-arcane-gradient`).
- Primary palette: midnight blues (`midnight.*` in Tailwind config), accents in cyan/indigo.
- Severity uses a yellow→red gradient mapping levels 1–5.
- Avoid official game logos, fonts, or copyrighted art. Use generic shapes, gradients, and color.

## Components
- Severity pill (1–5): low=yellow, critical=red. Prefer labels: Low, Moderate, Notable, High, Critical.
- Addon tags are compact chips with severity color.
- Cards have soft borders (`ring-white/10`) and hover glow (`shadow-glow`).

## Layout
- Content max width is 6xl with generous spacing on sections.
- Sticky top navbar with transparent blur background.

## Accessibility
- Maintain sufficient contrast in dark mode.
- Prefer semantic HTML and keyboard-focusable elements.

## Content and legal
- Show only links and minimal metadata for Wowhead articles; do not copy full content.
- Attribute via outbound links; open in new tabs for external links.
