### Prefer Browser-Based Testing

- When providing testing instructions for API routes or admin flows in this project, prefer steps that can be executed directly in the browser over command-line cURL.
- Use URLs under `/admin` when possible, and suggest using the browser devtools Network tab for verification.
- When authentication is required, instruct to visit `/admin`, log in with the admin password, then trigger admin endpoints by navigating to links or using the devtools Console `fetch` calls.
- Only fall back to cURL when browser testing is not feasible.

References for routes:
- Admin login: [app/api/admin/login/route.ts](mdc:app/api/admin/login/route.ts)
