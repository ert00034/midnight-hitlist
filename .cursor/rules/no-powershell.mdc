# Terminal Command Execution Policy

This workspace must not execute terminal commands directly. The user's allowlist blocks PowerShell; executing commands from the assistant can invalidate their Cursor allowlist.

- Do not invoke any terminal/shell commands from the assistant.
- Do not use the tool that runs shell/terminal commands in this workspace.
- Never execute PowerShell commands (or cmd.exe), and never background any process.
- When commands are helpful, present them as instructions for the user to run manually, using fenced code blocks, and clearly label them as user-run commands. Do not run them yourself.
- Prefer cross-platform command examples where possible; provide Windows variants when relevant, but still do not execute them.
- Use read-only tools (e.g., search and file read/edit tools) to make changes, not shell commands.

Example (instruction only; do not execute):

```bash
# User-run example
npm install
npm run dev
```
